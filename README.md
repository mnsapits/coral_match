# Coral Match

Coral Match is an educational version of the well known card matching game. The purpose is to help users in learning about different types of saltwater corals, invertebrates, and fish through a fun, interactive and challenging game. One card will have a photo of the saltwater animal and while the other will have a brief description and a name. The user will flip cards arranged on the screen looking for pairs of matching images. Once a pair has been found the cards will remain flipped. After all pairs have been found the user will be able to play the next level with different animals.
